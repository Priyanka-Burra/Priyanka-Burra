## Hi there! 👋 I’m Priyanka Burra  
### Data Science | Data Analyst  

I’m a data professional passionate about using data to uncover insights, explain patterns, and support informed business decisions.  
I enjoy working across the full data lifecycle — from **data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to **analysis, visualization, and insight communication**, with a strong focus on **business-oriented problem solving**.

Currently, I’m strengthening my skills in **machine learning, data visualization, and analytics** through hands-on projects and real-world problem statements.  
I’m particularly interested in **business analytics, dashboards, and applied machine learning** that drive measurable impact.
