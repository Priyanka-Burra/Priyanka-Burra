Hi there! 👋 I’m Priyanka Burra

Data Science | Data Analyst

I’m a data professional passionate about using data to uncover insights, explain patterns, and support informed business decisions. I enjoy working across the full data lifecycle — from data cleaning and EDA to analysis, visualization, and insight communication — with a strong focus on practical, business-oriented problem solving.

Currently, I’m strengthening my skills in machine learning, data visualization, and analytics through hands-on projects and real-world problem statements. I’m particularly interested in business analytics, dashboards, and applied machine learning that drive measurable impact.
