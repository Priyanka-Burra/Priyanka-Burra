Hi there! 👋 I’m Priyanka Burra  
Data Science | Data Analyst

Hello! 👋 I’m **Priyanka Burra**, a **Data Science enthusiast and Data Analyst** driven by a strong curiosity about how data can be used to understand patterns, support decisions, and solve real-world business problems. I’m passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful insights through analysis, visualization, and analytical thinking.

I enjoy working with data across its lifecycle — from **cleaning and exploration** to **drawing insights and communicating results** in a clear and impactful way. My approach focuses on practical, business-oriented problem solving rather than just technical implementation.

Currently, I am focused on strengthening my skills in **data science, machine learning, and data visualization** through continuous learning and hands-on practice. I actively work on improving my analytical reasoning and applying data-driven approaches to realistic problem statements that reflect real industry use cases.

I am particularly interested in **business analytics, dashboarding, and applied machine learning**, where data can directly influence strategy, efficiency, and decision-making. I am eager to grow as a data professional and contribute meaningfully in environments that value learning, collaboration, and data-driven thinking.
